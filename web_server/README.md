# Multi-threaded Web Server
With this project I hope to put together my Rust skills that I've learned so far. This is my first Rust project. I will be following along the last exercise in the Rust book noting any details or changes I make. I plan to improve the error handling that they implement.

Use: cargo run in the hello directory will run the server. It can handle 10 connections at once by default, but this can be changed by switching the number in the .take() finction in line 20 of main.rs.
